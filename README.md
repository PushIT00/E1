Encounter One Ship Builder

The Encounter One ShipBuilder is a project I created to further my JavaScript and jQuery skills. It is intended to recreate and simplify a process for building starships, included in Encounter One, a set of wargame rules published by Starfleet Studies in 1980.

The builder has several stages to go through:

1. Create framework in HTML5/CSS3 [x]
2. Build objects of all ship components [x]
3. Display a list of components with icons and costs [x]
4. Filter the list by race, selected from a dropdown [x]
5. When a component is selected, populate the 'canvas' with the icon, plus a hull icon [x]
6. Increment statistics and costs as components are selected - display in stats pane [ ]
7. Code limits to items, grey out or remove as necessary [ ]
8. Code complex items like beams and shields [ ]
9. Implement drag and drop grid for icons on the canvas [ ]
10. Work out logic for self-arranging components [ ]
11. JSON export of completed ships [ ]
12. login system with access to dropbox [ ]
13. Native format exporter
14. PDF exporter [ ]
15. Next project - build game simulator using ships built with this system -->
